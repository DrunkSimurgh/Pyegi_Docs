# Executing Scripts

## Choose a Script

In the [main window](../../miscellaneous/picture-dictionary/main.md), users need to select a script from the dropdown menu.

## Set Parameters Value

Then they need to choose which lines the script should be applied on, and click "Next" button to either for the script to be applied or be redirected to the [script window](../../miscellaneous/picture-dictionary/script.md).

## Run

If the user is redirected to the script window, they need to set the proper parameters and run the script.

These three steps are shown in the following video:
