After installation, choose Pyegi from the Automation menu in Aegisub. The [main window](../miscellaneous/picture-dictionary/main.md) pops up consequently.

At first, there are no scripts installed. So, you need to [install some scripts](../how-to-use/for-users/scripts-installation/install-update.md).

After scripts installation, you may [run any of the scripts](../how-to-use/for-users/executing-scripts.md) that is installed.
