# Installation

In order to install Pyegi, you may clone it from its [Github page](https://github.com/SSgumS/Pyegi), extract the zipped file and using windows PowerShell, run the file `install.bat` from the extracted files. Although the installation process is currently only available for Windows, the Pyegi itself is cross-platform compatible, so if it is installed correctly, it should run on other platforms as well.
